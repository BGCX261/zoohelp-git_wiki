#summary Base functionality

= Users and security =
Users can register and become registered users.

Users can shape groups.

Users can create topics.

Topic started is automatically set as an admin of the topic.

A topic's readability can be public or protected:

  * Public topic: everyone can see it
  * Protected topic: only selected users and/or groups can see it

A topic can be assigned an admins, which can edit and delete messages.

There is a global administrator and moderators. Both can edit any messages in any topics. Moderators shape a 'network of trust', which means that a new moderator can be added by either the administrator or by 2 existing moderators voting for him.

= Publishing =
Every user can have a number of accounts to use with different services, like vk, facebook, twitter, news boards. A user can re-post a post from a topic using certain accounts he has access to. There are 2 kinds of services to target:
  * API-based services (vk, facebook, twitter)
  * Services without API(sladno, SMF or different kind of forum etc). Those will be processed with HTMLUnit and probably Spredfast automation framework when it gets opensourced.
